# mode-chordsProg-gen

This is a little script that given a musical key and mode will calculate all the possible chords on a guitar in all positions. Then it will access jguitar.com and do smoe DOM manipulation on the site to download those chord images. And in the end it will create new image files out of groups of downloaded images, aranging them in a matrix-like form.
